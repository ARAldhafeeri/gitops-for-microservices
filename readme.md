**GitSync**

GitSync is a concept where development teams use Git as the single source of truth for their microservice architecture. In this approach, each microservice is represented by a configuration file that defines the service's manifest, including its dependencies and how it communicates with other microservices within the system. The configuration files are stored in Git repositories, and any changes to the services are automatically reflected in the configuration.

Unlike distributed tracing, which tracks application requests as they flow across multiple microservices, devices, and entities, GitSync focuses on the **Continuous Integration (CI) stage**. It aims to identify issues early—when developers commit their code—by analyzing service configurations and dependencies. GitSync monitors changes and ensures that service versions, dependencies, and communication contracts between microservices are always in sync. This leads to fewer runtime errors and smoother deployments by preventing conflicts before they reach production.

This demo provides a basic overview of how GitSync works. We have three microservices: **Stock**, **Pricing**, and **ReStock**, which handle the Inventory business logic. Each of these services has its own configuration repository:

- [Pricing Service Config](https://github.com/ARAldhafeeri/pricing-service-config)
- [ReStock Service Config](https://github.com/ARAldhafeeri/restock-service-config)
- [Stock Service Config](https://github.com/ARAldhafeeri/stock-service-config)

These config repositories are used to sync the state automatically via the service in `main.js`. The goal is to check the desired state in `service.yaml` for each service to ensure that versions are properly upgraded. This results in two scenarios:

- **All handshakes successful**: All versions match, the global handshake status is updated to `true`, and each service’s status is set to `true`.
- **One or more handshakes fail**: If any service fails to match the expected version, the global status is updated to `false`, and the failed service is flagged for review.

This is done in "strict sync mode," but the process can be relaxed or modified based on other modes and configurations.

For this demo, the system currently compares service versions. In the future, it could be extended to compare the `interface.yaml` (outbound policies) with the dependency's Swagger contract. This would ensure that both the interface and service version are in sync, reducing integration issues and making deployments smoother.

### **Try it out**

To get started, simply create a `/work` directory. Then run:

```bash
node main.js
```

If you want to try it with your own repositories, you can check out the example repos, then send a POST request to `/handshake` with the repository URL you are trying to get GitSync status for.

### **How GitSync can be helpful**

GitSync can be incredibly helpful in **managing microservices at scale**. Here’s how:

1. **Early Issue Detection**: By analyzing configuration files at the commit stage, GitSync helps identify issues such as mismatched service versions, missing dependencies, or broken communication contracts early in the CI process—before they make it into production. This reduces the risk of runtime errors, or cascading faliures in microservices.

2. **Automatic Synchronization**: With GitSync, you can ensure that the state of all microservices is automatically kept in sync, based on their configuration files stored in Git. This eliminates manual intervention and reduces human error. Since the desired state is written by senior team members within your teams, and the actual state is ran by the system automatically, the example provide webhook, however, adding the functionality of corn job can be simple. 

3. **Improved Visibility and Traceability**: GitSync provides visibility into the state of each microservice, allowing teams to see which services are up to date, which ones are in sync, and which ones require attention—all in real-time. On the Continous integration stage, which can prevent painful to fix cascading errors in production due to human error. 

4. **Simplified Dependency Management**: With microservices depending on one another, keeping track of service versions and contracts can be complicated, especially if your team manages hundered of microservices. GitSync simplifies this by managing service dependencies and ensuring they align with the desired state.

5. **Continuous Integration Confidence**: By ensuring that all microservices are in sync, development teams can confidently deploy services, knowing that version mismatches or communication issues have already been addressed.

6. **Customizable Sync Modes**: GitSync allows for flexibility in how strictly services are kept in sync. Teams can define their own modes (strict or relaxed) to suit different environments (e.g., production vs. staging).

7. **Scalability**: As the number of microservices in a system grows, manually managing configuration files and ensuring compatibility becomes impractical, painful. GitSync automates this process, allowing teams to scale their microservice architecture without additional overhead.


Note: This is just conceptial demo of the idea, still alot of work to be done, feedback to make this applicable.
