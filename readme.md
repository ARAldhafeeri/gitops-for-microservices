# GitSync

GitSync is concept at which development teams make git as the source truth of their microservice architecture. Where for every microservice there is a config file, where they store manifiest about the microservice, it's dependencies and how it communicate with other microservices within the system.

It's oppisite to distributed tracing where we trace applicatin rewquests as they flow between multiple microservices, devices, entities...

GitSnyc aims to find issues in the Continous Integration stage, where user commit their code.

This is a basic demo, to run this demo just create /work directory.
